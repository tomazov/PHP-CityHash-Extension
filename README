Working on porting Google's CityHash (https://github.com/google/cityhash/tree/master/src) to its own PHP PECL Extension.

CityHash is awesome, I'd love to see its adoption spread and I thought that a PECL extension for it might help. I wrote an alpha-version of it and it creates cityhash64/cityhash128 functions.
***
<?php
$test = array('I', 'do', 'not', 'know', 'about', 'making', 'awkward', 'rhopalic', 'sentences', '.');
foreach ($test AS $a) {
        echo cityhash64($a) .' - '. $a . PHP_EOL;
        echo cityhash128($a) .' - '. $a . PHP_EOL;
}
***
Just phpize/configure/make to create the extension. It isn't fully polished (missing licenses and comments), but works great and is really just 6 hours away from being 1.0 worthy. I'd love your feedback on this.
